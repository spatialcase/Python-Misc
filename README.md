# Python-Misc

A collection of miscellaneous python scripts.

## fme_data_formats.py
Script tp parse all the file formats that FME reads and write their file extensions out to a CSV file.
The formats read by FME are provided for the formats.db file which lives in C:\Program Files\FME folder.
formats.db is actually a CSV file using a "|" delimiter.
Thanks to redgeographics for the tip about this file.
